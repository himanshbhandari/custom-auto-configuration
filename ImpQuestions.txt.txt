1. Why we used @AutoConfiguration?
2. @EnableAutoConfiguration?
3. is spring boot created all bean when we create desktop standalone application so it create web bean also if No so how spring boot detacted?
4. what is @ConditionalOnClass annotation do ? how it create bean conditionally?====>
	So when @ConditionalOnClass(className.class) so if this className.class is present on class path(inside depedency pom.xml) then bean will created.
